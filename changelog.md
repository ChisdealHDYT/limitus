## 2.0.0 - 2015-11-11

 * **Breaking:** changed the behaviour of the `continuous` mode. Previously, its interval was taken to be the time it takes to 'remove' one limit count. Now, it more sensibly represents the total number of events which can happen in the given time interval.
 * Performance fixes and improvements.
